			I would look for an individual who embraces the principles of <em>Extreme Ownership</em>.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			"A good leader must be: confident but not cocky; courageous but not foolhardy; competitive but a gracious loser; attentive to details but not obsessed by them; strong but have endurance;â€¨a leader and follower; humble not passive; aggressive not overbearing; quiet not silent; calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions; close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge. able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command. A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove."

		<p>All I would truly need for a strong female lead is someone who understands their "why" and is willing to own that position and strives to communicate their position clearly. This will inevitably inspire those around them to pursue the "what" with a greater intensity. This is true strength of character.</p>
